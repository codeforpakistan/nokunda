**Combating Power Theft**

NoKunda is an open-source, cross-platform smartphone application, the aim of which is to report and curb electricity theft in Pakistan.

Developed as a civic initiative under the banner of **Code for Pakistan** and **KP IT Board**, it can obviously be used in any other country where the menace of power theft exists. The aim of the civic initive is to use technology to solve our daily life problems, and to encourage governments in supporting the general public to come up with their own solutions for the common good.


###Development
---
It's a cross-platform smartphone application, developed in the Appecelerator Titanium Studio with a single codebase targeting both Android OS/iOS.

This is a completely different approach from the native app development, which is done in either Java or Objective-C, and targets only the supported platforms like Android or iOS, respectively.

For cross-platform development in Titanium Studio, coding is done in "JavaScript" with Titanium's APIs providing abstraction from the native Android/iOS APIs.
